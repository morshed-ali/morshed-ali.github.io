I am Md Morshed Ali, a prospective PhD student in Computer Science and Lecturer in the Department of CSE at Uttara University. I have hands‑on teaching and mentoring experience in core CS courses and actively collaborate on research projects bridging computer security, computer vision, and NLP. My recent work evaluates feature selection strategies for cardiovascular disease prediction and develops efficient deep models for malware image classification.

I am seeking a PhD position to advance trustworthy and privacy‑preserving machine learning with applications to healthcare and critical cyber systems. I am particularly interested in adversarial robustness, interpretable vision models for medical imaging, and secure ML deployment in resource‑constrained settings.

## Research Interests

- Adversarial machine learning and privacy-preserving ML
- Medical imaging and robust computer vision systems
- Applied NLP for healthcare and public sector data

If you're a faculty member or researcher working in these areas, I'd be excited to connect and explore potential PhD opportunities.
